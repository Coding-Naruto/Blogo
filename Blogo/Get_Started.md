# Outline for Blogo: An AI Powered Blog Website
Creating an AI-powered blog website using Go (Golang) and template pages involves several steps. Here's a high-level plan to guide you through the process:

1. **Setup the Go Environment:** Ensure you have Go installed and set up on your machine.
2. **Initialize the Project:** Create a new Go project and initialize it.
3. **Create the Basic Structure:** Set up the directory structure for your project.
4. **Build the Server:** Implement the main server logic using Go's net/http package.
5. **Templates for HTML Pages:** Use Go's html/template package to create and manage HTML templates.
6. **AI Integration:** Integrate AI functionalities like natural language processing using available libraries or APIs.
7. **Database Setup:** Set up a database to store blog posts and other relevant data.
8. **Routing:** Implement routing to handle different endpoints.
9. **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for blog posts.
10. **User Authentication:** Add user authentication for managing posts.
11. **Deploy the Website:** Deploy the website on a hosting service.

## Step 1: Setup the Go Environment
Ensure you have Go installed. You can download and install Go from ![golang.org].

## Step 2: Initialize the Project
Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project. Initialize the Go module.
    `mkdir ai_blog
    cd ai_blog
    go mod init ai_blog`

## Step 3: Create the Basic Structure
Create the necessary directories and files.
    `mkdir -p cmd/server
    mkdir -p internal/handlers
    mkdir -p internal/models
    mkdir -p templates
    touch cmd/server/main.go
    touch internal/handlers/handlers.go
    touch internal/models/models.go
    touch templates/home.html
    touch templates/layout.html
    touch templates/post.html`

## Step 4: Build the Server
Edit `cmd/server/main.go` to set up a basic HTTP server.

## Step 5: Templates for HTML Pages
Edit `templates/home.html, layout.html, post.html, edit.html, view.html` to create layouts.

## Step 6: Handlers
Edit `internal/handlers/handlers.go` to handle the routes.

## Step 7: Database Setup
We'll use SQLite for simplicity. You can switch to any other database if needed.
    i. Install SQLite and a Go ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library: We'll use gorm for this purpose.
        `go get -u gorm.io/gorm
        go get -u gorm.io/driver/sqlite`
    
    ii. Set up the database model:
    Edit `internal/models/models.go` to create a database model.

## Step 8: CRUD Handlers
Edit `internal/handlers/handlers.go` to support CRUD operations.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Integrate AI Summarization
We'll demonstrate how to integrate AI summarization using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
    ## Step 1: Install Required Libraries
    Install the transformers and torch libraries.
        `go get github.com/go-resty/resty/v2`
    
    ## Step 2: Create AI Summarization Function
    Edit `internal/ai/ai.go` and add the following code to implement the summarization functionality.

    ## Step 3: Update Handlers to Use AI Functionality
    Edit internal`/handlers/handlers.go` to use the AI summarization function.

    ## Step 4: Create View Template
    Create a new template templates/view.html to display the blog post and its summary.

    ## Step 5: Update Routes
    Update the routes in cmd/server/main.go to include the new view route.
